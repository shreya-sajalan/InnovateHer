### Project Description
Women Safety app 

Emergency SOS:
Users can quickly send an emergency alert to predefined contacts or authorities with a single tap. The SOS feature may include loud alarms, flashing lights, or discreet notifications to draw attention or scare off potential threats.

Location Sharing:
Real-time GPS tracking allows users to share their live location with trusted contacts, ensuring their whereabouts are known in case of an emergency or during travel.

Fake Call:
A simulated call feature helps users escape uncomfortable or unsafe situations by generating a fake incoming call, providing an excuse to leave.

Emergency Contacts:
Users can store and prioritize emergency contacts who will be notified immediately during an SOS activation, ensuring quick response from trusted individuals.

Safety Tips:
The app provides practical safety advice, self-defense tips, and awareness guidelines to help users stay vigilant and prepared in various situations.]
